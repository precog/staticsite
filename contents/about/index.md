            <h2>John De Goes</h2>
            <h3>Chief Executive Officer - Chief Technical Officer - Founder</h3>
            <p>John began his journey into computer science at the age of 8, when he taught himself to program BASIC on a Commodore 64. Eight years later, John was writing best-selling books in 3D graphics programming. After graduating Summa Cum Laude with a degree in mathematics, John launched his career as a research and development engineer, eventually turning his creativity toward entrepreneurship. John's latest company was acquired by LivingSocial for technology developed under his leadership as VP of Engineering. With more than a decade of experience in distributed and scientific computing, John is the vision and brains behind Precog, relentlessly pursuing his dream of powering the data-driven future.</p>
            <p>When not contributing to open source, speaking at conferences, or working at Precog, John enjoys spending time with his wife and two kids, hiking the Rocky Mountains, cooking fine food, and weight-training like a madman.</p>

            <h3>Director of Platform Engineering - Co-Founder</h3>
            <p>Kris Nuttycombe didn't start out in technology, but while writing research software while finishing his BA in geology he inadvertently stumbled upon his true passion for computing. An early whirlwind career in the technology startups of the late '90s was followed by years of working on large distributed geospatial data systems for the government while he pursued a Master's in machine learning. Finding the pace of progress in government corridors too slow, he dove back into the startup world in 2007 and has become as passionate about entrepreneurism as he is about writing immaculate software.</p>
            <p>When not writing software for work, Kris has far too many things going on in his life. A father of 2, rock climber, biathlete, archer, inveterate gamer, blacksmith, hobby programmer, machinist, gardener, cook, chicken and rabbit raiser, hunter, medieval re-creationist, go-player, and all-around do-everything-yourselfer, he needs more time to sleep.</p>

            <h2>Matthew De Goes</h2>
            <h3>Graphic Designer - Co-Founder</h3>
            <p>Matthew has spent the better part of the last decade in the graphic design field. At first, in character/environment illustration and then by adding website and graphic design to his skill set. After years in the freelance community, he accepted a full-time graphic designer position with Precog. If you see a zombie, robot, data-hero, or gradient on this site or in print form, it was likely his brainchild. As graphic designer and web developer for Precog, his mission is to create strong brand recognition, improve website usability and make all Precog visuals amazing.</p>
            <p>When he's not stitching together virtual zombies, Matthew enjoys weight training, spending time with his wife, continually improving his artistic talents and listening to audiobooks.</p>

            <h2>Daniel Spiewak</h2>
            <h3>Senior R&amp;D Engineer</h3>
            <p>Daniel Spiewak started toying with programming languages at the age of eight. After teaching himself BASIC by trial and error, he ventured forward into Java, Ruby, C++, SML and eventually Scala. Fascinated by the theoretical underpinnings of programming languages, Daniel devoured papers and books on type theory, parser theory and theory of computation. With little else useful to which he could apply such a random collection of arcana, Daniel began to write and speak avidly on the conference circuit, something he continues to this day.</p>
            <p>In the time not spent plotting ways to improve Quirrel as a language or streamline its vast underpinnings, Daniel enjoys hiking in the mountains, gaming, playing the piano, reading late-19th century British fiction and teaching himself statistics. He earnestly wishes the personal automobile would be abandoned by society in favor of bicycles and public transit.</p>

            <p>Tom has been programming since he entered his teens. He managed to follow this passion through to university, where he found a particular taste for algorithms and data structures. After school, Tom bounced around a couple hospitals, developing bioinformatics software, before finally landing at Precog.</p>
            <p>When not developing software at Precog, Tom develops software at home. When that gets tiring, he likes to cook, work on cars, and enjoy the outdoors (snowboarding, canoeing, camping, and ... playing golf).</p>

            <p>Brian started computing at the age of 3 by inputting BASIC commands into an Amstrad CPC. He later started developing websites and learned to properly program with JavaScript. After working as a web developer with PHP and JavaScript, Brian decided to look for something more powerful. He discovered functional programming via Haskell and became a proponent of proofs as programs.</p>
            <p>Brian has since created a few popular open-source projects. Roy: a functional language that compiles to JavaScript. Bilby.js: a functional library for JavaScript. OSXMonad: a port of XMonad to Mac OS X.</p>

            <p>Alissa Pajer started full-time programming in Scala when she joined the Precog team. Before her coding days, she studied pure mathematics, earning a Bachelors from Carleton College. After graduation she moved to Boulder and spent her time tutoring high school students and undergraduates in math. Hanging around campus, she found herself missing the rigors of academia, so she earned her Masters at CU Boulder. Currently, she works on Quirrel language development and the implementation of machine learning algorithms. She also uses vim. And programs with vigor.</p>
            <p>When she's not at work, she's either running up a mountain, riding her bike, swimming at the reservoir, or skiing. She is also known to read books, peruse xkcd, and eat vegan ice cream.</p>

            <h3>Senior R&amp;D Engineer</h3>
            <p>Erik discovered Unix and C in 1999 and never looked back. Since then, he's primarily worked as a systems programmer, on projects ranging from expert systems and data interchange to GIS, modeling and simulation. Since 2010 he's been active in the Scala community, developing compiler plugins and libraries as well as contributing patches to the Scala compiler. His interest in data structures, specialization, and functional programming derives from a fundamental desire to make things fast.</p>
            <p>Outside of work Erik spends a lot of time around powerful amplifiers, open source software projects, and urban decay.
